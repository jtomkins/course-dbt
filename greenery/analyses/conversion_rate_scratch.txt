-- Conversion rate by product is defined as the # of unique sessions with a purchase event 
-- of that product / total number of unique sessions that viewed that product
-- what is considered a purchase event, the action of add to cart or checking out?
-- as a consumer i know i leave items in carts without checking out 
-- if the product converstion rate is to measure the products ordered wouldnt 
-- use the order items table since the event table doesnt include the product id for those orders whose event status is checkout?
